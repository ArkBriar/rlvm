(For full history, please see the internal git changelog)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3:
- CLANNAD is playable through the end of Nagisa's route. CLANNAD Full Voice is
  still not supported; it uses new opcodes in the new menu system.
- Support for newer RealLive games that have individual XOR keys; CLANNAD Full
  Voice edition now boots up (though does little else).
- Replace name variables in text, such as '*A' as 'Tomoya' in CLANNAD.
- index_series: The function is now partially implemented; Kanon SE no longer
  enters an infinite loop during 'Last Regrets,' and CLANNAD Full Voice will
  get past the copyright screen.
- Reduce the memory footprint by keeping the last 100 pages of text in the
  scrollback buffer. Previously, the scrollback buffer was unbounded.
- Support CG commands; any game that includes a CGM file should now
  automatically track which CG images were viewed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2:
- WARNING: rlvm 0.2 breaks compatibility with version 0.1's save
  files! rlvm 0.2 will write save files in a different location.
- Support for background music and sound effects
  - Note: Character voices are still unsupported.
- Support for custom cursors
- Users can no longer resize the screen. Users could previously shrink
  the screen and not display all the contents, or they could enlarge it
  and have a large black empty area.
- Internal code cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1: (The first one!)
- Initial public release
