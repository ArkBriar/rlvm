(For full history, please see the internal git changelog)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.1:
- Preliminary support of the CLANNAD_FV English patch:
  - Fixed multiple tokenization errors in rlvm's bytecode tokenizer.
  - Add support for floating name boxes.
- General CLANNAD_FV fixes:
  - Fix loading save games from the in game menu.
  - Fix display of two characters talking at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6:
- Lots of improvements to CLANNAD_FV:
  - Support newer mouse cursors
  - Support hierarchical objects (used in menus)
  - Implement support for voice in OVK archives. rlvm still does not read the
    older KOE and NWK archives.
- Support selection buttons (used during Fuuko's "donna itazura wo?" selections
  in CLANNAD)
- Note: rlvm currently doesn't work with the English patches released by the
  Baka-Tsuki CLANNAD translation wiki. There appears to be a problem parsing
  the bytecode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.5:
- There's now an implementation of rlBabel. This has only been tested with
  NDT's Kanon preview patch. It has not been tested with any of the patches
  from the Key Fan Club or any other Chinese or Korean patches.
- Fix a large number of graphical glitches including the calendar in Kanon
  blinking in and out and the CGs at the end of routes in CLANNAD not always
  clearing as the end credits are displayed.
- New Kanon save games will restore the graphical contents of the screen
  properly; old Kanon save files will show a black background. I wasn't
  recording the status of the graphics stack properly.
- Game info can be brought up by hitting [F1].
- Fix OpenGL 1.4 support; Version 0.4 only worked on OpenGL 2.0 or higher
  graphics cards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4:
- CLANNAD is playable from a clean file to the end of After Story True End;
  side routes and bad ends have not been tested.
- All routes in Kanon SE ALL are playable.
- There's now a partial default interface, allowing basic operations and a
  default save/load interface in games that don't provide their own (such as
  Kanon).
- NOTE: There is still no support for rlBabel; text in translation patches
  still won't display correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3:
- CLANNAD is playable through the end of Nagisa's route. CLANNAD Full Voice is
  still not supported; it uses new opcodes in the new menu system.
- Support for newer RealLive games that have individual XOR keys; CLANNAD Full
  Voice edition now boots up (though does little else).
- Replace name variables in text, such as '*A' as 'Tomoya' in CLANNAD.
- index_series: The function is now partially implemented; Kanon SE no longer
  enters an infinite loop during 'Last Regrets,' and CLANNAD Full Voice will
  get past the copyright screen.
- Reduce the memory footprint by keeping the last 100 pages of text in the
  scrollback buffer. Previously, the scrollback buffer was unbounded.
- Support CG commands; any game that includes a CGM file should now
  automatically track which CG images were viewed.
- Scrolling through previous pages of text no longer crashes Planetarian.
- Support for skipping previously read text.
- Fix performance on the CLANNAD main menu.
- Fix rare race condition between the audio thread and the main thread by
  grabbing the global SDL audio lock when 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2:
- WARNING: rlvm 0.2 breaks compatibility with version 0.1's save
  files! rlvm 0.2 will write save files in a different location.
- Support for background music and sound effects
  - Note: Character voices are still unsupported.
- Support for custom cursors
- Users can no longer resize the screen. Users could previously shrink
  the screen and not display all the contents, or they could enlarge it
  and have a large black empty area.
- Internal code cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1: (The first one!)
- Initial public release
- Planetarian is playable through the end.
- Missing sound support and HIK animation support
