Included version of libsdl_ttf: Debian patched r2.0.8-3.

This is not the current most recent version of SDL_ttf, nor is it a clean
vendor version; this is the debian patched version and I used this version to
work around a bug in text displaying that was triggered in Japanese
fonts. Attempting to update this to clean v2.0.9 should be done early in the
rlvm 0.5 devcycle.
