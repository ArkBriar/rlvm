CLANNAD FULL VOICE
------------------
- All routes playable to the end.

- Partially playable with the Baka-Tsuki English patch (currently beta)

Tomoyo After
------------
- I have verified that the game starts. (No other testing has happened)
- I assume that the dungeon crawler parts are broken.
- Requires unwritten NWK support for voices.

Planetarian CD
--------------
- Requires unwritten NWK support for voices. Otherwise works.

Little Busters (Ex)
-------------------
- Both Little Busters and Little Busters Ecstasy start up and are playable for
  a while.
  - Battle system slow and graphically buggy.
  - Breaks hard at baseball. I assume it'll break at the shooting, too.

Princess Bride
--------------
- Playable to the end with the caveat that the user doesn't click to skip the
  fake "ending" sequence on Wedding Day. (This is a bug in rlvm).

Princess Brave
--------------
- Appears to work. Game starts, story mode appears to work. I can't play
  Riichi Mahjong, so maybe the mahjong parts are broken?

ALMA ~Zutto soba ni~
--------------------
- Can complete Yui's route. Haven't tested any other paths.
- There's a bunch of stuff broken in the OP.

SNOW Standard Edition
---------------------
- Displays copyright/disclaimer screen.
- Main menu doesn't show due to large number of haikei commands not written.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
- Considering how much this relies on the grp commands, I'm surprised
  this works as well as it does.
- Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
