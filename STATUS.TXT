GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
* Starts
* Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
* Menu correctly animates in (except for 
* Menu items highlight on mouseover and work when clicked on. 
  * Clicking load has RLVM complain about <1:Sys:03001> (menu_load) not being 
    implemented.
  * Clicking on enter name glitches. The cancel button, and the big circular button
    are rendered over the Kanon backdrop. owarisuru is rendered on top of some 
    smaller button. Nothing works, ^C.
  * owarisuru shuts down the interpreter cleanly.
* (Actual game doesn't work)
* (Hack the SEEN_START to point to the OP/Last Regrets to watch ammusing
  glitching)

Planetarian
-----------
* Starts
* Displays what I assume is an antipiracy message
* Correctly renders menu, items highlight on mouseover. Crashes on start game.
  May be crashing or exiting on clicking owari.

CLANNAD
-------
* Starts...with key logo misplaced at top left
* The log says that expressions aren't being parsed correctly. 
* Main menu is the glitchiest of the three:
  * White BG with only 12 glowing dots on the right side of the screen. Missing BG?
  * CLANNAD logo fades in on right side of screen
  * Basic menu appears...the disapears, only to be replaced with the menu with
    "After Story" and the CG and Music modes after clicking once.
  * After that happens, menu items are highlightable.
    * Clicking New game takes me to a white screen. Have to ^C.
    * Load brings me to the load menu, but it's glitching. It's asking me something,
      but rendering the hai/iie buttons twice, obsucuring what it's trying to ask 
      me. The buttons don't work. ^C.
    * CG Mode renders the number zero in the top right corner,
      the clickable numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, the verb modoru, and link to sound mode.
      * sound mode link doesn't work
      * modoru correctly brings me back to the main menu.
    * Sound Mode (when selected from main menu): Renders one single box in the 
	  near upper right, and on the bottom right: 1, 2, ???, modoru, cg mode.
      * cg mode crashes the interpreter with an uncaught exception.
      * modoru works
    * Config:
      * Exceptions are constantly being throw in expression parser. Ouch.
      * The push buttons on the first page of options (the one with fullscreen
        option) toggle state.
      * On the other option pages, all scroll bars work in one direction: down.
        No idea what's up with that.
      * Will return to main menu.
    * Name:
      * Only three buttons are rendered, of which cancel is the only one that has
        any discernable effect, taking me back to the main menu.
    * Exit + an additional quit shut down interpreter, but there's an exception
      in the log
