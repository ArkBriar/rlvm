GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
* Starts
* Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
* Menu correctly animates in
* Menu items highlight on mouseover and work when clicked on. 
  * Clicking load has RLVM complain about <1:Sys:03001> (menu_load) not being 
    implemented.
  * Clicking on enter name glitches. The cancel button, and the big circular button
    are rendered over the Kanon backdrop. owarisuru is rendered on top of some 
    smaller button. Nothing works, ^C.
    [Haeleth: right-click works to return to menu]
  * owarisuru shuts down the interpreter cleanly.
    [Haeleth: owarisuru dumps core]
    [Elliot: I just tried on both my mac and my linux box; can't reproduce 
             crash. Core file/stack trace please?]
* (Actual game doesn't work)
* (Hack the SEEN_START to point to the OP/Last Regrets to watch ammusing
  glitching)

Planetarian CD
--------------
* Starts
* Displays what I assume is an antipiracy message
* Correctly renders menu, items highlight on mouseover. Crashes on start game.
  May be crashing or exiting on clicking owari.
  [Haeleth: exits cleanly for me, unlike Kanon!]

CLANNAD
-------
* Starts
* Main menu is the glitchiest of the three:
  * White BG with only 12 glowing dots on the right side of the screen. Missing BG?
  * CLANNAD logo fades in on right side of screen
  * Basic menu appears, but it looks like some extra (non-selectable) menu items
    are just hanging out in the top left corner of the screen.
  * After that happens, menu items are highlightable.
    * Clicking New game takes me to a white screen. Have to ^C.
    * Load brings me to the load menu, but it's glitching. It's asking me something,
      but rendering the hai/iie buttons twice, obsucuring what it's trying to ask 
      me. The buttons don't work. There is a modoru button partially under, and 
	  that does bring you back to the main menu.
    * Config:
      * The push buttons on the first page of options (the one with fullscreen
        option) toggle state.
      * On the other option pages, the scrollbars work fine. [confirming Haleth]
        [Haeleth: they all work perfectly for me...]
      * Will return to main menu.
    * Name:
      * Only three buttons are rendered, of which cancel is the only one that has
        any discernable effect, taking me back to the main menu.
    * Exit + an additional quit shut down interpreter, but there's an exception
      in the log

ALMA ~ZUTTO SOBA NI~ COMPLETE EDITION
-------------------------------------
* Starts, displays 18kin warning, piracy warning, Bonbee!'s logo. Then
  appears to do nothing because ALMA jumps straight into the opening
  movie. If you wait awhile, there's a bit of graphical glitches. ^C
* --start-seen 2010: Menu will fade in, but items are unselectable.

KOUKA TRIAL
-----------
* Starts
* Main menu options do not appear

MAIDEN HALO TRIAL
-----------------
* Black screen

TRANCE KISS TRIAL
-----------------
* Displays colourful background, but no splashes or copyright notice
* Exits after about 10 seconds (due to lack of text support)

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
* Language-select menu doesn't appear
* Warnings in log about "?.g00"
* Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
