GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
* Starts
* Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
* Menu correctly animates in
* Menu items highlight on mouseover and work when clicked on. 
  * Clicking load has RLVM complain about <1:Sys:03001> (menu_load) not being 
    implemented.
  * Clicking on enter name glitches. The cancel button, and the big circular button
    are rendered over the Kanon backdrop. owarisuru is rendered on top of some 
    smaller button. Nothing works, ^C.
    [Haeleth: right-click works to return to menu]
  * owarisuru shuts down the interpreter cleanly.
* (Actual game still doesn't work, but at least it changes to the snow 
  backgrop on new game, and if you hold ctrl down, you can go through
  the prologue to the OP/Last Regrets.)

Planetarian CD
--------------
* Starts
* Displays what I assume is an antipiracy message
* Correctly renders menu, items highlight on mouseover. 
  * Clicking New Game works. 
    * "It is a tale told by..." "Key." 
	* "Puranetariamu wa ikaga deshyou?" *sniff*
    * Goes all the way up to where the game text starts.
  * Exits cleanly with a clean stack; no more exception from ret()

CLANNAD
-------
* Starts
* Main menu is the glitchiest of the three:
  * Menu background image fades in properly, CLANNAD logo then fades in
  * Basic menu appears, but it looks like some extra (non-selectable) menu items
    are just hanging out in the top left corner of the screen.
  * After that happens, menu items are highlightable.
    * Clicking New game takes me to a white screen. Have to ^C.
    * Load brings me to the load menu, but it's glitching. It's asking me something,
      but rendering the hai/iie buttons twice, obsucuring what it's trying to ask 
      me. The buttons don't work. There is a modoru button partially under, and 
	  that does bring you back to the main menu.
    * Config:
      * The push buttons on the first page of options (the one with fullscreen
        option) toggle state.
      * On the other option pages, the scrollbars work fine. [confirming Haleth]
        [Haeleth: they all work perfectly for me...]
      * Will return to main menu.
    * Name:
      * Only three buttons are rendered, of which cancel is the only one that has
        any discernable effect, taking me back to the main menu.
    * Exit + an additional quit shut down interpreter, but there's an exception
      in the log

ALMA ~ZUTTO SOBA NI~ COMPLETE EDITION
-------------------------------------
* Starts, displays 18kin warning, piracy warning, Bonbee!'s logo. Then
  appears to do nothing because ALMA jumps straight into the opening
  movie. If you wait awhile, there's a bit of graphical glitches. ^C
* --start-seen 2010: Menu will fade in, but items are unselectable.

KOUKA TRIAL
-----------
* Starts
* Main menu options do not appear

MAIDEN HALO TRIAL
-----------------
* Black screen

TRANCE KISS TRIAL
-----------------
* Displays colourful background, but no splashes or copyright notice
* Exits after about 10 seconds (due to lack of text support)

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
* Warnings in log about "?.g00"
* Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
