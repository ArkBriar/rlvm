Planetarian CD
--------------
- Requires unwritten NWK support for voices. Otherwise works.

Little Busters (Ex)
-------------------
- The original edition is clearable, including the Refrain. There are many
  graphical glitches and blank screens during CG events, but all text displays.
- No testing has been done with Little Busters Ecstasy past making sure the
  game starts.

Princess Bride
--------------
- Playable to the end; all routes.
- Doesn't display cards.
- Post Wedding-Day, there are graphical artifacts.

Princess Brave
--------------
- Appears to work. Game starts, story mode appears to work. I can't play
  Riichi Mahjong, so maybe the mahjong parts are broken?

ALMA ~Zutto soba ni~
--------------------
- Can complete Yui's route. Haven't tested any other paths.
- There's a bunch of stuff broken in the OP.

SNOW Standard Edition
---------------------
- Displays copyright/disclaimer screen.
- Main menu doesn't show due to large number of haikei commands not written.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
- Considering how much this relies on the grp commands, I'm surprised
  this works as well as it does.
- Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
