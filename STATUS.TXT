GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
* Starts
* Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
* Menu correctly animates in
* Menu items highlight on mouseover and work when clicked on. 
  * Clicking load has RLVM complain about <1:Sys:03001> (menu_load) not being 
    implemented.
  * Clicking on enter name glitches. The cancel button, and the big circular button
    are rendered over the Kanon backdrop. owarisuru is rendered on top of some 
    smaller button. Nothing works, ^C.
    [Haeleth: right-click works to return to menu]
  * owarisuru shuts down the interpreter cleanly.
* Playable through the prologue. Glitches and hangs during Last Regrets.

Planetarian CD
--------------
* Starts
* Displays what I assume is an antipiracy message
* Correctly renders menu, items highlight on mouseover. 
* Clicking New Game works. 
* Playable for several dozens pages, until it crashes when asked to
  load a texture larger then OpenGL can handle.

CLANNAD
-------
* Starts
* Main menu is the glitchiest of the three:
  * Menu background image fades in properly, CLANNAD logo then fades in
  * Basic menu appears, but it looks like some extra (non-selectable) menu items
    are just hanging out in the top left corner of the screen.
  * After that happens, menu items are highlightable.
    * Clicking New game opens to new game.
    * Load brings me to the load menu, but it's glitching. It's asking me something,
      but rendering the hai/iie buttons twice, obsucuring what it's trying to ask 
      me. The buttons don't work. There is a modoru button partially under, and 
	  that does bring you back to the main menu.
    * Config:
      * The push buttons on the first page of options (the one with fullscreen
        option) toggle state.
    * Name:
      * Only three buttons are rendered, of which cancel is the only one that has
        any discernable effect, taking me back to the main menu.
    * Exit + an additional quit shut down interpreter, but there's an exception
      in the log
* Main game is playable until end, assuming that all questions are
  answered with the first choice, which leads to a bad end, and
  returns to the main menu.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
* Warnings in log about "?.g00"
* Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
