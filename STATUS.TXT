GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
- All routes playable to the end
- No screen shaking, no inversion, and other graphical glitches.

CLANNAD
-------
- All routes playable to the end, from a clean file to After Story True End.
- No screen shaking, no inversion, and other graphical glitches.
- Several Fuuko selections which should have custom graphics are displayed like
  any other selection.

Planetarian CD
--------------
- Planetarian is playable through the end, with the following caveats:
  - In the intro, some functions regarding Haikei are used. The Haikei
    functions, and the corresponding HIK file format have not been
    reverse engineered. 
  - There are minor issues with indentation that need to be worked out.

CLANNAD FULL VOICE
------------------
- Doesn't even get to the main menu.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
- Considering how much this relies on the grp commands, I'm surprised
  this works as well as it does.
- Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
