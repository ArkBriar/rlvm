GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
* Starts
* Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
* Menu correctly animates in (except for 
* Menu items highlight on mouseover and work when clicked on. 
* (Actual game doesn't work)
* (Hack the SEEN_START to point to the OP/Last Regrets to watch ammusing
  glitching)

Planetarian
-----------
* Starts
* Displays what I assume is an antipiracy message
* Correctly renders menu, items highlight on mouseover, but do not work.

CLANNAD
-------
* Starts...with key logo misplaced at top left
* The log says that expressions aren't being parsed correctly. 
* Main menu is the glitchiest of the three:
  * White BG with only 12 glowing dots on the right side of the screen. Missing BG?
  * CLANNAD logo fades in on right side of screen
  * Basic menu appears...the disapears, only to be replaced with the menu with
    "After Story" and the CG and Music modes.
  * After that happens, menu items are highlightable. Clicking on them produces no
    effect.
