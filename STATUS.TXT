GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL
------------
- Starts
- Fades Key logo in/out (snow effect unimplemented)
- Main menu works except for load
  - Clicking load has RLVM complain about <1:Sys:03001> (menu_load) not being 
    implemented.
- Playable through the prologue. 
- Gets through most of Last Regrets, but glitches right after the part
  with Ayu getting wings. Theoretically caused by index_series.
  - Small graphics glitch: vertical blind transition effect doesn't
    clear the screen after each character portrait

Planetarian CD
--------------
- Planetarian is playable through the end, with the following caveats:
  - In the intro, some functions regarding Haikei are used. The Haikei
    functions, and the corresponding HIK file format have not been
    reverse engineered. 
  - There are minor issues with indentation that need to be worked out.

CLANNAD
-------
- Main menu renders correctly; the option menu (for the most part)
  works correctly; most options can be set (and will be remembered
  between invocations)
- Main game may be playable until the end
  - Things *appear* to work (but I haven't tested things in depth)
  - ctrl-ing through most of the game, I got a weird hang on a
    selection; Clicking on one of the items (which highlighted on
    mouse over properly) would not advance. Needs investigation.
- In game menu mostly works.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
- Considering how much this relies on the grp commands, I'm surprised
  this works as well as it does.
- Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
