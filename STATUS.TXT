GAME COMPATIBILITY STATUS
=======================================================================

Kanon SE ALL

- All routes playable to the end
- No screen shaking, no inversion, and other graphical glitches.
- Playable with NDT's English patch.

AIR

CLANNAD FULL VOICE
------------------
- All routes playable to the end.
- Voices work.
- Partially playable with the Baka-Tsuki English patch (currently beta)

Tomoyo After
------------
- I have verified that the game starts. (No other testing has happened)
- I assume that the dungeon crawler parts are broken.
- Requires unwritten NWK support for voices.

Planetarian CD
--------------
- Planetarian is playable through the end, with the following caveats:
  - There are minor issues with indentation that need to be worked out.
- Requires unwritten NWK support for voices.

Little Busters
--------------
- The game doesn't even start. 100% broken.

Princess Bride
--------------
- Playable to the end with the caveat that the user doesn't click to skip the
  fake "ending" sequence on Wedding Day. (I am not sure if this is due to a bug
  in rlvm or in Pricness Bride).

Princess Brave
--------------
- Appears to work. Game starts, story mode appears to work. I can't play
  Riichi Mahjong, so maybe the mahjong parts are broken?

ALMA ~Zutto soba ni~
--------------------
- Can complete Yui's route. Haven't tested any other paths.
- There's a bunch of stuff broken in the OP.

UNOFFICIAL "ONE" DEMO
---------------------
- Considering how much this relies on the grp commands, I'm surprised
  this works as well as it does.
- Quite a lot works; the things that don't are quite instructive!
