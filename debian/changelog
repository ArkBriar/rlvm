rlvm (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * CLANNAD is now playable from a clean file to After Story True End. No
    testing has been done on side routes, though they may be playable.
  * All routes in Kanon Standard Edition are playable and have been tested.
  * There's now a partial default interface, allowing basic operations and a
    default save/load interface in games that don't provide their own (such as
    Kanon).
  * NOTE: There is still no support for rlBabel; text in translation
    patches still won't display correctly.

rlvm (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * CLANNAD is playable through the end of Nagisa's route.
  * Replace name variables in text, such as '*A' as 'Tomoya' in CLANNAD.
  * Kanon SE is now playable past "Last Regrets," but the lack of loading
    or saving makes actual playing impracticle.
  * Reduce the memory footprint by keeping the last 100 pages of text in the
    scrollback buffer. Previously, the scrollback buffer was unbounded.
  * Scrolling through previous pages of text no longer crashes Planetarian.
  * Fix performance on the CLANNAD main menu.
  * Fix multiple crashing bugs.
