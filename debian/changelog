rlvm (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * CLANNAD is playable through the end of Nagisa's route.
  * Replace name variables in text, such as '*A' as 'Tomoya' in CLANNAD.
  * Kanon SE is now playable past "Last Regrets," but the lack of loading
    or saving makes actual playing impracticle.
  * Reduce the memory footprint by keeping the last 100 pages of text in the
    scrollback buffer. Previously, the scrollback buffer was unbounded.
  * Scrolling through previous pages of text no longer crashes Planetarian.
  * Fix performance on the CLANNAD main menu.
  * Fix multiple crashing bugs.
