* RLVM
** Redo the graphics layer so graphics data lives on the graphics
  card. As is, we have an SDL_Surface in main memory, which uploads
  its data to the graphics card. And then hangs around to be blitted
  against itself and 
*** Effect: Half our runtime is spent uploading memory to the graphics
    card.
*** Stopgap: implement lazy updating, so that full images don't get
    uploaded each time.
*** Real fix: 
**** Remove SDL_Surface from the system. Make loadSurfaceFromFile
      take the raw data and upload it to the graphics card. 
**** Switch from the SDL_Surface based SDL_ttf to the OpenGL ftgl.
