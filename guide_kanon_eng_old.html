	  <h1>Installing the Kanon patch under Linux</h1>

      <p><span style="color: red;">WARNING</span>: This guide describes installing an outdated teaser patch and
      will not help you install the final Kanon translation patch. It is kept
      for historical reasons. You can find the current
      guide <a href="guide_kanon_eng.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <em>(Note: All commands are examples. Depending on your linux
        distribution, you may need to adjust paths, commands, et cetera.)</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have wine installed. (We will need it to run the
          Kanon English patch installer; not to play Kanon.)
          <div class="codebox">$ sudo apt-get install wine</div>
        </li>
        <li>Copy the files from your <em>Kanon Standard Edition</em> or
          <em>Kanon Standard Edition All Ages Version</em> CD to your hard
          drive in a new folder. For example:
          <div class="codebox">$ cp -R /media/cdrom0/ ~/Kanon.eng </div>
        </li>
        <li>The fine people at <a href="http://radicalr.pestermom.com/vn.html">
            Non-directional Translations</a> have created a teaser patch, with
            a full patch coming Real Soon Now. Download the installer from
            their website.
        </li>
        <li>Use wine to run the installer.
          <div class="codebox">$ wine ~/Desktop/KanonTeaser.exe </div>
          You should see the first part of the installation wizard:
          <div class="centerimage">
            <img src="screenshots/guide_kanon_eng/1.jpg"
                 alt="The Kanon English Patch installation wizard"/>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>Select the directory you copied the CD contents to:
          <div class="centerimage">
            <img src="screenshots/guide_kanon_eng/2.jpg"
                 alt="The Kanon English Patch installation wizard"/>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>After finishing the installation, you will see the following dialog
          window:
          <div class="centerimage">
            <img src="screenshots/guide_kanon_eng/3.jpg"
                 alt="The Kanon English RealLive.exe Patcher"/>
          </div>
          <em>You do not need to do anything with this window and can safely
            click exit.</em> This file translates strings inside the
            RealLive.exe interpreter. You'll be using <code>rlvm</code> to play
            the patch, so just click Exit.
        </li>
        <li>You should be able to play the NDT patched Kanon by running:
          <div class="codebox">$ rlvm ~/Kanon.eng</div>
          <div class="centerimage">
            <img src="screenshots/kanon_eng_main_menu.jpg"
                 alt="The Kanon English RealLive.exe Patcher"/>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
