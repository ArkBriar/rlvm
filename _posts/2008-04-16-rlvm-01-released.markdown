title: rlvm 0.01 released!
tags: [rlvm]

After a year and a half of hard work, I'm pleased to announce the first release of <a href="/rlvm">rlvm</a>. rlvm is a Free Software reimplementation of the VisualArt's KK's RealLive interpreter. It is meant to provide Linux and Apple users with a compatible, portable interpreter to play VisualArts games, specifically those released by Key.

As this is the first publicly released version, there are bound to be bugs. The machine is missing major features. (See KNOWN ISSUES in README.TXT.) Right now, only Planetarian is playable through the end.

rlvm compiles on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon (and most likely any modern Linux distribution), Mac OSX 10.4 Tiger, and Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard.
