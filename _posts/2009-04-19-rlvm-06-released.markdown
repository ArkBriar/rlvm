title: rlvm 0.6
---

Supports the Full Voice edition of CLANNAD, with several general improvements
to all versions of CLANNAD. Most notably, rlvm 0.6 supports the Ogg Vorbis
voice archives used in CLANNAD Full Voice edition. (Older KOE and NWK archives
are not yet supported).

Currently, English patches to CLANNAD are known to not work. (And I suspect
that they never did.) Specifically, I've tested with the SEEN.TXT files on <a
href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clannad">Assembla</a> and things aren't
working. More investigation is needed. rlvm still works properly with the NDT
Kanon patches.

By popular demand, OSX application are now universal binaries again. (I am not
sure how many more releases will have universal binaries because my old G4
laptop is dieing.)
