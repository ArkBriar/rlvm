Contains initial support for the CLANNAD English patch, available at the
CLANNAD translation wiki's Assembla page. This is a minor update and only fixes
obvious problems early in the game (i.e. crashing at startup). Despite this
disclaimer, I haven't gotten a crash with the SEENr28\_FV.TXT currently up on
Assembla (though I have only played about half an hour in). Note: The recently
posted SEENr30\_FV.TXT doesn't work; I am not sure why.

In addition, this version fixes reported issues with CLANNAD\_FV.
